# Dragit
Experimental application for intuitive file sharing between devices.

The network part is using `libp2p` and custom protocol for file transfer.
The frontend is ran on `gtk-rs`.

**Important note**: This is software in early development phase and you should use it at your own risk.

## How to use

![demo](./static/dragit.gif)

Please download the latest [release](https://github.com/sireliah/dragit/releases/) for your OS and unpack it. Currently you can use `dragit` on 64-bit Linux and Windows (Please check [Windows requirements](#windows-requirements) for details).

1. Start the application on two machines:

For Linux:
```
./dragit
```

For Windows:
```
dragit.exe
```

You can run two `dragit` instances on the same machine for testing. No problem with that!

2. Wait for the two `dragit` instances to discover each other. You should see new drop zone area with IP address of the host.
3. Drag a file and drop it on the drop zone.
4. In the other window you will be asked whether you would like to accept the file. Probably you'd like to answer "Yes".
5. File will be transfered and saved in the `Downloads directory` (which is customizable).
6. Done!

## Development
### How to build on Linux
```
cargo run
```

### How to build on Windows
`Dragit` works best on `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` target. Detailed build instruction will be added in the future.

#### Windows requirements
It might happen that you don't have the `vcruntime140_1.dll` installed in your system and the application won't start. You can fix that by installing the [VC++ 2019 runtime dll](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads). 

In the future releases this library will be installed automatically.

### Performance
Please build in the release mode to get the best performance (roughly 16-20x faster).

```
$ cargo build --release

$ ./target/release/dragit
```

### Bluetooth support
`Dragit` can use Bluetooth OBEX protocol for file transfer through the D-Bus BlueZ interface, which should work on most of the Linux devices. This future needs some work and is disabled now.

### TODOs
#### Features
- find out how to use text drag&drop API on Windows with Gtk 
- show username in the device list
- have list of trusted devices
- add files queue
- re-enable the Bluetooth

#### Maintenance
- TCP retransmissions - what is wrong?
- fix the outbound memory issue (consumes too much memory on file reading)
- add Windows CI/CD
- add timeout on the Accept/Deny event
- inject_dial_upgrade_error - but why not inbound?
- adjust network timeouts

### Done
- show easy to understand instruction on startup
- show details about the host
- choose directory
- show version in the title bar
- crashes when no network interface is available
- implement error events
- TransferCommand::Accept should specify which file should be accepted
- add sender side progress bar
- fix the inbound memory issue
- add logging
- add test for the outbound/inbound
